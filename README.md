Authlib-LoginPass Presentation
### This project was built using Python 2.7. However, Python 3 should work fine with the code (See app.py for any differences in syntax).
### Instruction
#### pip install authlib
#### Must have GitHub or Google API keys. Follow this link (https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/) to create a GitHub App and find your api and secret key from your App's dashboard.
#### Ideal to use virtual environment of your choice in order to prevent breaking of system (as you may need to install python 2.7).
#### For any code references use documentation and codes from Auhtlib's website (https://authlib.org/)
